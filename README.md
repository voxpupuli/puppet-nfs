## Module Description

Github Master: [![Test Suite](https://github.com/derdanne/puppet-nfs/actions/workflows/test-suite.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/derdanne/puppet-nfs/actions/workflows/test-suite.yaml)

This module installs, configures and manages everything on NFS clients and servers.

This module is a complete refactor of the module haraldsk/nfs, because Harald Skoglund sadly is not
maintaining his module actively anymore. It is stripped down to use only the class 'nfs'
and parametrized to act as a server, client or both with the parameters 'server_enabled'
and 'client_enabled'. It also has some dependencies on newer stdlib functions like 'difference'.

It supports the OS Families Ubuntu, Debian, Redhat, SUSE, Gentoo and Archlinux. It supports also Strict Variables, so if you pass all
OS specific parameters correctly it should work on your preferred OS too. Feedback, bugreports,
and feature requests are always welcome, visit https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-nfs or send me an email.

When you are using a puppet version 3.x like it is shipped with Redhat Satellite 6, please use a version 1.x.x from puppet forge
or the branch puppet3 when cloning directly from Github. (Note: https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-nfs/pull/49#issuecomment-285091678).
I'll recommend using puppet >= 4.6.1, puppet versions up until 4.6.0 had various issues.

If you want to contribute, please do a fork on github, create a branch "feature name" with your
features and do a pull request.

Warning: I've introduced new dependencies with version 2.1.0 which were needed to fix buggy rpcbind-socket restarting with systemd:
- puppetlabs/transition
- herculesteam/augeasproviders_core
- herculesteam/augeasproviders_shellvar

## Setup

### What puppet-nfs affects

This module can be used to configure your nfs client and/or server, it could export
nfs mount resources via storeconfigs or simply mount nfs shares on a client. You can
also easily use the create_resources function when you store your exports i.e. via hiera.

### Setup requirements

This Module depends on puppetlabs-stdlib >= 4.5.0 and puppetlabs-concat >= 1.1.2, you need to
have these modules installed to use puppet-nfs module.

### Beginning with puppet-nfs

On a nfs server the following code is sufficient to get all packages installed and services
running to use nfs:
```puppet
  node server {
    class { '::nfs':
      server_enabled => true,
    }
  }
```
On a client the following code is sufficient:
```puppet
  node server {
    class { '::nfs':
      client_enabled => true,
    }
  }
```

## Usage

### Simple NFSv3 server and client example

This will export /data_folder on the server and automagically mount it on client.

```puppet
  node server {
    class { '::nfs':
      server_enabled => true
    }
    nfs::server::export{ '/data_folder':
      ensure  => 'mounted',
      clients => '10.0.0.0/24(rw,insecure,async,no_root_squash) localhost(rw)'
    }
  }

  # By default, mounts are mounted in the same folder on the clients as
  # they were exported from on the server
  node client {
    class { '::nfs':
      client_enabled => true,
    }
    Nfs::Client::Mount <<| |>>
  }
```

### Simple NFSv4 client example

This will mount /data on client in /share/data.

```puppet
  node client {
    class { '::nfs':
      server_enabled => false,
      client_enabled => true,
      nfs_v4_client => true,
      nfs_v4_idmap_domain => $::domain,
    }

    nfs::client::mount { '/share/data':
        server => '192.168.0.1',
        share => 'data',
    }
  }
```


### NFSv3 multiple exports, servers and multiple node example

```puppet
  node server1 {
    class { '::nfs':
      server_enabled => true,
    }
    nfs::server::export { '/data_folder':
      ensure  => 'mounted',
      clients => '10.0.0.0/24(rw,insecure,async,no_root_squash) localhost(rw)',
    }
    nfs::server::export { '/homeexport':
      ensure  => 'mounted',
      clients => '10.0.0.0/24(rw,insecure,async,root_squash)',
      mount   => '/srv/home',
    }
  }

  node server2 {
    class { '::nfs':
      server_enabled => true,
    }
    # ensure is passed to mount, which will make the client not mount it
    # the directory automatically, just add it to fstab
    # The directory on the NFS server is not created automatically.
    nfs::server::export { '/media_library':
      ensure     => 'present',
      nfstag     => 'media',
      clients    => '10.0.0.0/24(rw,insecure,async,no_root_squash) localhost(rw)',
      manage_dir => false,
    }
  }

  node client {
    class { '::nfs':
      client_enabled => true,
    }
    Nfs::Client::Mount <<| |>>
  }

  # Using a storeconfig override, to change ensure option, so we mount
  # all shares
  node greedy_client {
    class { '::nfs':
      client_enabled => true,
    }
    Nfs::Client::Mount <<| |>> {
      ensure => 'mounted',
    }
  }


  # only the mount tagged as media
  # also override mount point
  node media_client {
    class { '::nfs':
      client_enabled => true,
    }
    Nfs::Client::Mount <<| nfstag == 'media' |>> {
      ensure => 'mounted',
      mount  => '/import/media',
    }
  }

  # All @@nfs::server::mount storeconfigs can be filtered by parameters
  # Also all parameters can be overridden (not that it's smart to do
  # so).
  # Check out the doc on exported resources for more info:
  # http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/exported_resources.html
  node single_server_client {
    class { '::nfs':
      client_enabled => true,
    }
    Nfs::Client::Mount <<| server == 'server1' |>> {
      ensure => 'absent',
    }
  }
```

### NFSv4 Simple example


```puppet
  # We use the $::domain fact for the Domain setting in
  # /etc/idmapd.conf.
  # For NFSv4 to work this has to be equal on servers and clients
  # set it manually if unsure.
  #
  # All nfsv4 exports are bind mounted into /export/$mount_name
  # and mounted on /srv/$mount_name on the client.
  # Both values can be overridden through parameters both globally

  # and on individual nodes.
  node server {
    file { ['/data_folder', '/homeexport']:
      ensure => 'directory',
    }
    class { '::nfs':
      server_enabled => true,
      nfs_v4 => true,
      nfs_v4_idmap_domain => 'example.com',
      nfs_v4_export_root  => '/export',
      nfs_v4_export_root_clients => '*(rw,fsid=0,insecure,no_subtree_check,async,no_root_squash)',
    }
    nfs::server::export { '/data_folder':
      ensure  => 'mounted',
      clients => '*(rw,insecure,async,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)',
    }
    nfs::server::export { '/homeexport':
      ensure  => 'mounted',
      clients => '*(rw,insecure,async,root_squash,no_subtree_check)',
      mount   => '/srv/home',
    }
  }

  # By default, mounts are mounted in the same folder on the clients as
  # they were exported from on the server

  node client {
    class { '::nfs':
      client_enabled  => true,
      nfs_v4_client   => true,
    }
    Nfs::Client::Mount <<| |>>
  }

  # We can also mount the NFSv4 Root directly through nfs::client::mount::nfsv4::root.
  # By default /srv will be used for as mount point, but can be overriden through
  # the 'mounted' option.

  node client2 {
    $server = 'server'
    class { '::nfs':
      client_enabled => true,
      nfs_v4_client  => true,
    }
    Nfs::Client::Mount::Nfs_v4::Root <<| server == $server |>> {
      mount => "/srv/${server}",
    }
  }
```

### NFSv4 insanely overcomplicated reference example


```puppet
  # and on individual nodes.
  node server {
    class { '::nfs':
      server_enabled      => true,
      nfs_v4              => true,
      # Below are defaults
      nfs_v4_idmap_domain => $::domain,
      nfs_v4_export_root  => '/export',
      # Default access settings of /export root
      nfs_v4_export_root_clients =>
        "*.${::domain}(ro,fsid=root,insecure,no_subtree_check,async,root_squash)",


    }
    nfs::server::export { '/data_folder':
      # These are the defaults
      ensure  => 'mounted',
      # rbind or bind mounting of folders bindmounted into /export
      # google it
      bind    => 'rbind',
      # everything below here is propogated by to storeconfigs
      # to clients
      #
      # Directory where we want export mounted on client
      mount     => undef,
      remounts  => false,
      atboot    => false,
      #  Don't remove that option, but feel free to add more.
      options_nfs   => '_netdev',
      # If set will mount share inside /srv (or overridden mount_root)
      # and then bindmount to another directory elsewhere in the fs -
      # for fanatics.
      bindmount => undef,
      # Used to identify a catalog item for filtering by by
      # storeconfigs, kick ass.
      nfstag     => 'kick-ass',
      # copied directly into /etc/exports as a string, for simplicity
      clients => '10.0.0.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async,no_root_squash)',
    }
  }

  node client {
    class { '::nfs':
      client_enabled      => true,
      nfs_v4_client       => true,
      nfs_v4_idmap_domain => $::domain,
      nfs_v4_mount_root   => '/srv',
    }

    # We can as you by now know, override options set on the server
    # on the client node.
    # Be careful. Don't override mount points unless you are sure
    # that only one export will match your filter!

    Nfs::Client::Mount <<| nfstag == 'kick-ass' |>> {
      # Directory where we want export mounted on client
      mount       => undef,
      remounts    => false,
      atboot      => false,
      #  Don't remove that option, but feel free to add more.
      options_nfs => '_netdev',
      # If set will mount share inside /srv (or overridden mount_root)
      # and then bindmount to another directory elsewhere in the fs -
      # for fanatics.
      bindmount   => undef,
    }
  }
```

### Simple create nfs export resources with hiera example

**Hiera Server Role:**

  classes:
    - nfs

  nfs::server_enabled: true
  nfs::client_enabled: false
  nfs::nfs_v4: true
  nfs::nfs_v4_idmap_domain: %{::domain}
  nfs::nfs_v4_export_root: '/share'
  nfs::nfs_v4_export_root_clients: '192.168.0.0/24(rw,fsid=root,insecure,no_subtree_check,async,no_root_squash)'


  nfs::nfs_exports_global:
    /var/www: {}
    /var/smb: {}
```
**Hiera Client Role:**
```yaml
  classes:

  nfs::nfs_server: 'nfs-server-fqdn'

```

**Puppet:**

```puppet

  node server {
    hiera_include('classes')
    $nfs_exports_global = hiera_hash('nfs::nfs_exports_global', false)

    $defaults_nfs_exports = {
      ensure  => 'mounted',
      clients => '192.168.0.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async,no_root_squash)',
      nfstag     => $::fqdn,
    }

    if $nfs_exports_global {
      create_resources('::nfs::server::export', $nfs_exports_global, $defaults_nfs_exports)
    }
  }

  node client {
    hiera_include('classes')
    $nfs_server = hiera('nfs::nfs_server', false)

    if $nfs_server {
      Nfs::Client::Mount <<| nfstag == $nfs_server |>>
    }

puppetlabs/concat >= 1.1.2

### Software versions needed:

facter > 1.6.2
puppet > 3.2.0

### Ruby Gems needed:

augeas

## Limitations
If you want to have specific package versions installed you may manage the needed packages outside of this
module (use manage_packages => false). It is only tested to use 'present', 'installed', 'absent',
'purged', 'held' and 'latest' as argument for the parameters server_package_ensure and client_package_ensure.

## Development

Derdanne modules are open projects. So if you want to make this module even better,
you can contribute to this module on [Github](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-nfs).

Before pushing PRs to Github i would recommend you to test your work locally. So you can ensure all test builds
on Travis CI were passing. I have prepared an easy way to test your code locally with the help of Docker.

For running the complete static code analysis, it is sufficient to run a `make test-all`.

### Default settings

I have set some defaults which you can change by setting the following environment variables.

#### PUPPET_VERSION

Changes the puppet version which will be used for the tests. Defaults to `6.0`.

#### STRICT_VARIABLES

Sets strict variables on or off. Defaults to `yes`.

#### RVM

Sets the ruby version which will be used for the tests. Defaults to `2.4.1`.

#### BEAKER_set

Sets the beaker docker target host. Defaults to `ubuntu-20.04`.

#### PUPPET_collection

Sets the puppet version for acceptance tests. Defaults to `puppet6`.

### Running tests

You can run the following commands to setup and run the testsuite on your local machine.

#### `make build`

Build a docker image with a Ruby version which is not available on Docker hub. Check out
`https://hub.docker.com/r/derdanne/rvm/` to see if i have already prepared a rvm build for the ruby version
you want to test. Take a look at the Dockerfile located in `spec/local-testing` if you want to customize
your builds.

#### `make pull`

Pull a prebuild rvm docker image with the Ruby version defined in the variable `RVM`.

#### `make install-gems`

Install all needed gems locally to `vendor/bundle`.

#### `make test-metadata-lint`

Run linting of metadata.

#### `make test-lint`

Run puppet lint tests.

#### `make test-syntax`

Run syntax tests.

#### `make test-rspec`

Run rspec puppet tests.

#### `make test-rubocop`

Run rubocop tests.

#### `make test-all`

Run the whole testsuite.

#### `make test-beaker`

Run puppetlabs beaker rspec tests.
